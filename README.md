# Ontology-Matching
In this project, we will propose an approach for ontologies alignment (simple (1:1) and complex (1:n), (m:n)) using owl2vec and other techniques using OAEI Dataset.


Elaborate alignments possess greater expressive capabilities compared to straightforward alignments, since they can encompass logical operators or transformation functions involving literal values within their correspondences.
